# Object Oriented Programming in Java  
Contains the code and resources related to the specialization from Duke & UCSD. The specialization can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming) while the resources are available [here](http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/). As a note relevant to the course _Structured Data_, Duke provides the integrated BlueJ environment for development which omits the `main` methods. I used `javac` and, therefore, applicable files will contain the `main` methods. 

## Structured Data
Exercises of Course 2: "Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data" in the specialization.

## Object Oriented Programming
Exercises of Course 3: "Oriented Programming in Java" in the specialization.
